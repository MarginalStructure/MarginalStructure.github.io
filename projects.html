    <h2> Projects </h2>
        <h3>Built Environment and Health </h3>
    <!--<img src='barcelona.JPG'>-->
            <p>My current interests centre on how neighbourhood environments shape our risk for developing disease. Every city-dweller has some direct experience of this. Whether through tangible things like sidewalks and bikepaths, or more ephemeral qualities like the bonds that form (or don't) between us and our neighbours, our urban environments shape how we make healthy or unhealthy choices. While a lot of great research has studied how things like urban sprawl are connected to rising rates of obesity, my research will take the next step to look at how neighbourhood design is associated with chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. </p>
        
            <p>On a more conceptual level, I'm also interested in whether using different measures of peoples' neighbourhood environments changes the associations we see between neighbourhoods and health. Some recent work I've done in collaboration with Professors <a href='https://stevenfarber.wordpress.com/'> Steven Farber</a> and <a href='http://thinkingspatial.com/'> Michael Widener</a> at the University of Toronto Department of Geography and Urban Planning has compared several measurement approaches to linking individuals' "exposure" to city neighbourhoods and their participation in active transportation (i.e. biking & walking).

        <h3>Air Pollution and the Built Environment</h3>
        <!––insert image here-->
            <p> An unavoidable fact of urban life, high levels of air pollution affect many of the areas where people most like to spend time. This is especially worrying as we're  encouraged to exercise and spend time outdoors, where air pollution may potentially negate some of the benefits of exercise or even cause us harm. Part of my research focuses on the links between air pollution and health in urban environments, and how different features of our neighbourhoods may moderate some of those relationships.</p> 
        
        <h3>Other Work</h3>
            <p>In the past I've worked on other topics in health services and neuroscience. Below you can find some examples of projects and links to published research (if available). </p>
