    <h3>Built Environment and Health </h3>

        <p>My current interest centres on how neighbourhood environments shape our risk for heart disease. Every city-dweller has some direct experience of this. Whether its tangible things like sidewalks and bikepaths, or more ephemeral qualities like the bonds that form (or don't) between us and our neighbours, our environments shape how we make healthy or unhealthy choices.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Along related lines, some recent work I've done in collaboration with Professors <a href='https://stevenfarber.wordpress.com/'> Steven Farber</a> and <a href='http://thinkingspatial.com/'> Michael Widener</a> at the University of Toronto Department of Geography and Urban Planning has focused on how we define our exposures to cities. Many studies only use individuals' home addresses to determine what environments they are exposed to. Most of us, however, spend great parts of our days away from home, and these non-residential environments can also play large roles in shaping our behaviours. This study looks at different ways we can incorporate information about the other locations individuals spend time.

    <h3>Other Work</h3>
    <p>In the past I've worked on other topics in health services and neuroscience. Below you can find some examples of my work and links to published research (if available). </p>
        <h4>Health Services Research</h4>

        </ul>
